          I Token-based authentication is stateless, so the token is not
            saved between requests.
            <br/><br/>
            The moment the user goes away from this page (e.g home)
            and comes back, the route looks for the token again
            <br/><br/>
            Here we simulate any resource/route that
            user can access in the server.
            <br/><br/>
            A great improvement could be to store token in localStorage
            upon successful login, and delete from localStorage on logout
